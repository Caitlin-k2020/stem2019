<h2>Skin Care</h2>

<p>  When we're talking about the future of the beauty industry, among all the many uncertainties are a few trends that are almost sure to continue: transparency and quality of ingredients, affordability, and sustainability. Kinship, a new direct-to-consumer skin-care line launching today, aims to check all of those boxes, and then some. </p>

<p>Created by two beauty industry veterans — Alison Haljun, formerly the vice president of marketing at Benefit Cosmetics, and Christin Powell, who cofounded Juice Beauty — Kinship is based on the principle of affordable wellness for everyone. And if that sounds all too familiar, the brand also offers some additional points of difference.

All the products contain what the brand calls the Kinbiome complex, a proprietary blend said to promote the balance of your skin microbiome and barrier.

"The [skin] microbiome itself refers to bacteria, yeast, and viral organisms that make up our base environment," explains board-certified dermatologist Dhaval Bhanusali, who is not affiliated with Kinship. Bhanusali explains that through a growing body of research we are starting to learn which organisms are beneficial and which are harmful to our skin's health, but cautions that our understanding of the microbiome, in general, is still in the preliminary stage.</p>

<p> "One of the big things with the biome is that it's early [in our understanding] and we are just now scraping the surface on our knowledge," he says. "It's important to remember that everything has a consequence."

Kinship is one of many skin-care brands betting big on products that are meant to balance the skin's microbiome. The Kinbiome, which is the base of all Kinship products, is a plant-based pre-probiotic, derived from the fermentation of lactobacillus (one of the most common and trendy probiotics out there, including in probiotic skin care).

What you won't find in the formulas: more than 1,300 ingredients that are considered "questionable," and therefore banned by the European Union, including sulfates, silicones, and parabens.</p>
